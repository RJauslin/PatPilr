#'
#' @param file_path A character string containing the path to the fastq file. The extenstion must be *.fastq
#' @param fastq1 A character string containing the path to the output folder with the namefile. The extenstion must be *.fastq and contains R1.
#' @param fastq2 A character string containing the path to the output folder with the namefile. The extenstion must be *.fastq and contains R2.
#' @param m A scalar value that represent the minimum required overlap length between two reads to provide a confident overlap.  Default 10.
#' @param M A scalar value that represent the maximum overlap length expected in approximately 90% of read pairs. Default 100.
#' @param x A scalar value that represent the maximum allowed ratio between the number of mismatched base pairs and the overlap length. Default 0.25.
#' @param t A scalar value that represent the number of worker threads. Default t = 4.
