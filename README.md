# PatPilr (dev branch)
Implementation of the tools PatPil in R

## Current version
* Current version : 1.1.7
* Last update : 2019-01-03


## Installation

* Linux
Before install the package you need to be sure that the package devtools is right installed on your machine. If you have any error messages when you try to install the package devtools then try to copy/paste the following dependencies on a terminal.

``` r
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev
```
and the in Rstudio or R :

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rjauslin/PatPilr")
library(PatPilr)
install.PatPil()
```

* Windows

In order to get the program PatPil, you need to install Rtools. Go to the URL https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and choose Rtools35.exe. Follow the setup instructions and when given the option to edit your PATH, take it. 


``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Rjauslin/PatPilr")
library(PatPilr)
install.PatPil()
```



## preTreatment

This function merges, demultiplex, and clean your fastq files. You are supposed to put only the fastq files specified by the ..._R1.fastq, ..._R2.fastq and the information needed for the demultiplexing.



``` r
#Linux
pathFolder <- "/home/raphael/Documents/......./working_directory/"
#Windows
pathFolderWindows <- "C:/Users/raphael/......./working_directory/"

preTreatment(pathFolder, # path to the working directory
  m = 10, # min overlap
  M = 100, # max overlap
  x = 0.25, # max mismatch density
  t = 4, # number of threads
  mismatch = FALSE, # allows 1 mismatch in tag if TRUE
  err = 0.01, # expected error
  slide = 50, # sliding window
  minlength = 60) # minimum length of sequences considered

```

### simple tag
You have to put in your working directory a file called **barcode.txt**. It is really important that the barcode file have the following format.

* **barcode.txt**

``` r
ACGAGTGCGT	name1.fastq
ACGCTCGACA	name2.fastq
AGACGCACTC	name3.fastq
AGCACTGTAG	name4.fastq
ATCAGACACG	name5.fastq
ATATCGCGAG	name6.fastq
CGTGTCTCTA	name7.fastq
CTCGCGTGTC	name8.fastq
...

```

### double tag
You have to put in your working directory three files called **forwardtag.txt**, **reversetag.txt**, and **primer.txt**. It is really important that the files have the following format.

* **forwardtag.txt**
Notice that there is no extension file such as .fastq
``` r
ACACACAC	ForwardTag1
ACGACTCT	ForwardTag2
ACGCTAGT	ForwardTag3
ACTATCAT	ForwardTag4
...
```

* **reversetag.txt**
Notice that there is no extension file such as .fastq
``` r
ACACACAC	ReverseTag1
ACGACTCT	ReverseTag2
ACGCTAGT	ReverseTag3
ACTATCAT	ReverseTag4
...
```

* **primer.txt**

``` r
CAAAATCATAAAGATATTGGDAC	GAAATTTCCDGGDTATMGAATGG
```

uncertain allowed nucleotide :

``` r
R = AG
Y = CT
S = GC
W = AT
K = GT
M = AC
B = CGT
D = AGT
H = ACT
V = ACG
```


## Dereplication

This function dereplicate your fasta files. You are supposed to put only the fasta files inside the working directory. The function will create two folders for temporary work. The first one is called *derep_ech* and the second one called *derep*. At the end of the program inside of the *derep* folder you will find two fasta files. **RC.fa** contains your passed sequences and the **RCNotpassed.fa** the sequences that have failed the selection.

``` r
Dereplicate(pathFolder, # path to the working directory
  within = 3, # threshold for the number of occurence of the sequence within a file
  between = 2) # threshold for the number of occurence of the sequence between files
```


## trimBase

The package PatPilr allows you to trim primers on a reference database. In order to get some 100% of match when you assign your sequences, you have to compare with sequences that have the same "configuration". Hence, you possibly need to trim your reference base with some primers.

``` r
trimBase(fastaPath, # path to the reference base
  outputFasta, # path to the output
  primerForward, # The character string representing your forward primer.
  primerReverse, # The character string representing your reverse primer.
  trim = 0, # A scalar integer representing the number of nucleotide that you want allowed to be trimmed on the primers.
  l_min = 100, # A scalar integer representing the minimal length of the sequences considered.
  l_max = 500, # A scalar integer representing the maximal length of the sequences considered.
  keepPrimer = TRUE) # A boolean value, if you want to keep the primers with the sequences or not.
```

the PR2 database https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database as its own function which load the last reference database.


``` r
trimBasePR2(pathFile # path to the output
  primerForward, # The character string representing your forward primer.
  primerReverse, # The character string representing your reverse primer.
  trim = 0, # A scalar integer representing the number of nucleotide that you want allowed to be trimmed on the primers.
  l_min = 100, # A scalar integer representing the minimal length of the sequences considered.
  l_max = 500, # A scalar integer representing the maximal length of the sequences considered.
  keepPrimer = TRUE) # A boolean value, if you want to keep the primers with the sequences or not.
```


## utils

Some functions that could be useful.

# quality check
The quality check currently implemented evaluating the expected error in a sliding window and discarding sequences with more than percentage of error in the worst quality window http://taraoceans.sb-roscoff.fr/EukDiv/.

**IMPORTANT** : if this function is called in an other manners than by the function **preTreatment**, then the function append the files if it is called several times. Hence you should erase your files if your would like to recall the function.

``` r
call.qualCheck(fastqPath,
  outputFasta,
  t = 0.01, # expected error
  s = 50, # sligind window
  m = 60) # minimum sequence length
```

# Remove 'N'

These functions simply remove sequences of a fasta or a fastq files that contains a nucleotide 'N'.

* **fasta**

``` r
fastaPath <- ".../file.fasta"
outputFasta <- ".../fileWithoutN.fasta"
call.RemoveNfasta(fastaPath,outputFasta)
```
* **fastq**

``` r
fastqPath <- ".../file.fastq"
outputFastq <- ".../fileWithoutN.fastq"
call.RemoveNfastq(fastaPath,outputFastq)
```

# rmSmallSeq

This function simply removes the sequences of a fasta or a fastq files that are smaller than a fixed integer.

* **fasta**

``` r
fastaPath <- ".../file.fasta"
outputFasta <- ".../fileWithoutN.fasta"
call.rmSmallSeqfasta(fastaPath,
	outputFasta,
	sizemin = 80) # minimum size
```

* **fastq**

``` r
fastqPath <- ".../file.fastq"
outputFastq <- ".../fileWithoutN.fastq"
call.rmSmallSeqfastq(fastqPath,
	outputFastq,
	sizemin = 80)
```
