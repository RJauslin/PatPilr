abstract = {Marine plankton support global biological and geochemical processes. Surveys of their biodiversity have hitherto been geographically restricted and have not accounted for the full range of plankton size. We assessed eukaryotic diversity from 334 size-fractionated photic-zone plankton communities collected across tropical and temperate oceans during the circumglobal Tara Oceans expedition. We analyzed 18S ribosomal DNA sequences across the intermediate plankton-size spectrum from the smallest unicellular eukaryotes (protists, {\textgreater}0.8 micrometers) to small animals of a few millimeters. Eukaryotic ribosomal diversity saturated at {\~{}}150,000 operational taxonomic units, about one-third of which could not be assigned to known eukaryotic groups. Diversity emerged at all taxonomic levels, both within the groups comprising the {\~{}}11,200 cataloged morphospecies of eukaryotic plankton and among twice as many other deep-branching lineages of unappreciated importance in plankton ecology studies. Most eukaryotic plankton biodiversity belonged to heterotrophic protistan groups, particularly those known to be parasites or symbiotic hosts. T he sunlit surface layer of the world's oceans functions as a giant biogeochemical membrane between the atmosphere and the ocean interior (1). This biome includes plankton communities that fix CO 2 and other elements into biological matter, which then enters the food web. This biological matter can be re-mineralized or exported to the deeper ocean, where it may be sequestered over ecological to geological time scales. Studies of this biome have typically focused on either conspicuous phyto-or zooplankton at the larger end of the organismal size spectrum or microbes (prokaryotes and viruses) at the smaller end. In this work, we studied the taxonomic and ecological diversity of the intermediate size spectrum (from 0.8 mm to a few millimeters), which includes all unicellular eukary-otes (protists) and ranges from the smallest pro-tistan cells to small animals (2). The ecological biodiversity of marine planktonic protists has been analyzed using Sanger (3-5) and high-throughput (6, 7) sequencing of mainly ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene markers, on relatively small taxonomic and/or geographical scales, unveiling key new groups of phagotrophs (8), parasites (9), and phototrophs (10). We sequenced 18S rDNA metabarcodes up to local and global saturations from size-fractionated plankton communities sampled systematically across the world tropical and temperate sunlit oceans. A global metabarcoding approach To explore patterns of photic-zone eukaryotic plankton biodiversity, we generated {\~{}}766 million raw rDNA sequence reads from 334 plankton samples collected during the circumglobal Tara Oceans expedition (11). At each of 47 stations , plankton communities were sampled at two water-column depths corresponding to the main hydrographic structures of the photic zone: subsurface mixed-layer waters and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) at the top of the ther-mocline. A low-shear, nonintrusive peristaltic pump and plankton nets of various mesh sizes were used on board Tara to sample and concentrate appropriate volumes of seawater to theoretically recover complete local eukaryotic biodiversity from four major organismal size fractions: piconanoplankton (0.8 to 5 mm), nano-plankton (5 to 20 mm), microplankton (20 to 180 mm), and mesoplankton (180 to 2000 mm) [see (12) for detailed Tara Oceans field sampling strategy and protocols]. We extracted total DNA from all samples, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified the hypervariable V9 region of the nuclear gene that encodes 18S rRNA (13), and generated an average of 1.73 T 0.65 million sequence reads (paired-end Illumina) per sample (11). Strict bioinformatic quality control led to a final data set of 580 million reads, of which {\~{}}2.3 million were distinct, SCIENCE sciencemag.org},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate very large numbers of short reads. Even with very deep genome coverage, short read lengths cause problems in de novo assemblies. The use of paired-end libraries with a fragment size shorter than twice the read length provides an opportunity to generate much longer reads by overlapping and merging read pairs before assembling a genome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present FLASH, a fast computational tool to extend the length of short reads by overlapping paired-end reads from fragment libraries that are sufficiently short. We tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated read pairs, and we then applied it as a pre-processor for genome assemblies of Illumina reads from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and human chromosome 14. FLASH correctly extended and merged reads {\textgreater}99{\%} of the time on simulated reads with an error rate of {\textless}1{\%}. With adequately set parameters, FLASH correctly merged reads over 90{\%} of the time even when the reads contained up to 5{\%} errors. When FLASH was used to extend reads prior to assembly, the resulting assemblies had substantially greater N50 lengths for both contigs and scaffolds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The FLASH system is implemented in C and is freely available as open-source code at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/flash.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: t.magoc@gmail.com.},

@article{Edgar2015,
abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation sequencing produces vast amounts of data with errors that are difficult to distinguish from true biological variation when coverage is low. Results: We demonstrate large reductions in error frequencies, especially for high-error-rate reads, by three independent means: (i) filtering reads according to their expected number of errors, (ii) assembling overlapping read pairs and (iii) for amplicon reads, by exploiting unique sequence abundances to perform error correction. We also show that most published paired read assemblers calculate incorrect posterior quality scores. Availability and implementation: These methods are implemented in the USEARCH package.
