\title{Perform All primer (trimmed or uncertain nucleotide)}
\usage{
AllPrimer(primer, direction = "none", trim_nuc = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{primer}{A character string with uncertain nucleotide}

\item{direction}{A character string : "none", "forward" or "reverse"}

\item{trim_nuc}{A scalar value representing the number of nucleotide trimmed (in the choosed direction). Ignored if "none"}
}
\value{
A vector containing all unique combinations depending on the uncerain nucleotides.
}
\description{
This function is supposed to be internal and is used to create the primerforward.txt and primerreverse.txt files
 for the function \code{\link{preTreatment}}.
  It could be used if you would like to have all possible combinations of a primer with uncertain nucleotide.
}
\details{
Arguments which should be a character string for example : "CATTGAARARTTGVAT"

The uncertain characters are then transformed by following the transformations :

\itemize{
\item R = "AG"
\item Y = "CT
\item S = "GC",
\item W = "AT",
\item K = "GT",
\item M = "AC",
\item B = "CGT",
\item D = "AGT",
\item H = "ACT",
\item V = "ACG".
}

Careful about the number of uncertain nucleotide in the primer,
 the number of possible combinations can become very large.

\examples{
\dontrun{
primer <- "CATTGAARARTTGVAT"
primer <- "CRAAGAYGATYAGATSWMBACCRT"
AllPrimer(primer,direction = "forward",trim_nuc = 2)
AllPrimer(primer,direction = "reverse",trim_nuc = 10)
AllPrimer(primer,direction = "none",trim_nuc = 0)}
}
