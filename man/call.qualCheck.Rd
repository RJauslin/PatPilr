\usage{
call.qualCheck(fastqPath, outputFasta, t = 0.01, s = 50, m = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastqPath}{A character string containing the path to the fastq file. The extenstion must be .fastq.}

\item{outputFasta}{A character string containing the path to the output folder with the namefile. The extension must be .fasta.}

\item{t}{A scalar that represent the percentage of error allowed in the sliding window. Default = 0.01.}

\item{s}{A scalar that represent the size of the sliding window. Default = 50.}

\item{m}{A scalar that represent the minimum size of the sequence to be kept. Default = 60.}
}
\value{
Nothing, but work on the files.
}
\description{
This function calls the qualCheck program of the tool PatPil.
}
\details{
See the \url{http://taraoceans.sb-roscoff.fr/EukDiv/} for more informations on how the quality check is performed.

IMPORTANT : if this function is called in an other manners than by the function \link{preTreatment},
then the function append the files if it is called several times.
Hence you should erase your files if your would like to recall the function.
